import { SchemaRenderer } from "@/lib/docs/SchemaRenderer";
import { HeroSchema } from "@/lib/docs/examples/hero.schema";
import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

The `SchemaRenderer` is a powerful tool designed to showcase how your CMS schemas will look and behave in the admin panel. It provides a live, interactive preview of your fields, layouts, and validation rules.

## Basic Example

Here is a full example of a complex hero section schema rendered using the `SchemaRenderer`. This schema includes tabs, various field types, and a table-based repeater.

<Preview>
  <SchemaRenderer schema={HeroSchema} />

  ```tsx
  import { SchemaRenderer } from '@/lib/docs/SchemaRenderer';
  import { HeroSchema } from './hero.schema';

  <SchemaRenderer schema={HeroSchema} />
  ```
</Preview>

## Features

The `SchemaRenderer` supports all the core features of the Capsulo form builder:

- **Interactive Fields**: Try out the inputs, selects, and toggles.
- **Layouts**: Supports nested layouts like `Tabs` and `Grid`.
- **Validation**: Shows required fields and specific input types (like email).
- **Translations**: Visualizes translatable fields with the globe icon.
- **Repeaters**: Fully functional repeaters with different variants (like `table`).

<Callout type="info">
  The SchemaRenderer is currently read-only in terms of state persistence. It initializes with the `defaultValue` defined in your schema, allowing you to interact with it, but changes are not saved.
</Callout>

## How it works

The renderer takes a `Schema` object created with `createSchema` and maps it to high-level documentation components that mimic the actual CMS interface.

### The Schema

Here is the schema used in the example above:

<include>../snippets/hero-schema-code.mdx</include>
