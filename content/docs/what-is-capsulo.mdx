## The story

Hey! I'm Oriol M, the creator of Capsulo.
Everything started because I was tired of:
- Having to [reinvent the wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel) every time I wanted to build a content-driven website.
- The hassle of deploying the project when it was all done
- Those platforms who force you into their way of doing things, with little flexibility, or that even worse, you have to pay a fortune for basic features.

Capsulo aims to solve these problems by providing a flexible, type-safe, and repository-native CMS framework that makes your life easier by already handling the common tasks for you.

Never configure a translations system again, don't worry about databases or "where I will host this". Don't worry about performance, or scaling. **Just focus on building your website.**

## Philosophy

Capsulo is built on three core principles that guide every design decision:

### 1. Simplicity

Building content-driven websites shouldn't require complex configuration or learning curves. Capsulo embraces simplicity by:

- **Schema-as-Code**: Write your content schemas using familiar React/TSX components with a Fluent API.

<Preview>
  <div className="space-y-8 max-w-sm w-full">
    <InputField 
      field={{ 
        name: "title", 
        label: "Title",
        required: true,
        inputType: "text",
        placeholder: "Enter the article title"
      }} 
    />
    <TextareaField
      field={{ 
        name: "subtitle", 
        label: "Subtitle",
        placeholder: "Enter the article subtitle",
        maxLength: 100
      }} />
    <SwitchField
      field={{ 
        name: "published", 
        label: "Published",
        description: "Is the article published?"
      }} />
  </div>

- **GitHub-Native**: Your content lives in your repository, versioned and backed up automatically with Git.
Dont stress about databases, servers, or content versioning ever again.
- **Zero Infrastructure**: Deploy to any static host for free. No servers to maintain, no databases to manage.

### 2. Control

You own your content and control every aspect of how it works. Capsulo gives you:

- **Full Customization**: Write schemas as code, not through restrictive UIs. You decide the exact shape of your data and how it integrates with your components.
- **Type Safety**: Built with TypeScript and Zod for automatic type inference and runtime validation. This ensures your content adheres to the defined schemas. <span className='text-fd-muted-foreground'> Ex: If you define an Input type as "email", Capsulo wont let you save anything else than a valid email.</span>
- **No Lock-in**: Your content is stored in your repository as markdown and JSON. Switch frameworks or platforms anytime without losing your work.

Note that you need somewhere to host your images. Capsulo is powered by Cloudflare R2 by default but can be switched to any other storage provider.
</Callout>

### 3. Performance

Speed matters for both developers and end users. Capsulo delivers performance through:

- **Static-First Architecture**: Unlike traditional server-dependent CMS platforms, Capsulo uses a static-first approach powered by [Astro](https://astro.build/). This also translates into better SEO.
- **Build-Time Optimization**: Your data gets injected directly into your pages, so at the end you just have a bunch of static HTML and CSS. By default we dont ship any JS to the client unless you explicitly want to. <br/> <span className='text-fd-muted-foreground'>Learn more here:</span> [Astro feature: Zero JS by default](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#features)
- **Blazing Fast**: No database queries, no server processing. Capsulo will already handle stuff like image optimization, caching, and CDN distribution for you.
